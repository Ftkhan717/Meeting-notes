Following are the various aspects of Agile, Scrum, and project management. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

## Scrum Team:
 
* In a Scrum team, there are no managers. The team members are smart and self-organizing. They assign tasks to themselves and are responsible for completing them.
  
## Scrum Master Rotation:

* They talk about how in their team, they do Scrum master rotations, where each team member takes turns being the Scrum master for one or two sprints
 (a sprint typically lasts two weeks). This helps everyone understand the challenges and responsibilities of the role.

## Burn Down Chart:

* They mention using a burn down chart, which is a visual representation of the progress of tasks over time in a project.
 It helps the team and stakeholders to track task completion and overall project progress.

## Backlog and Sprint Backlog:

* They talk about the importance of maintaining a backlog for future planning, where tasks and user stories are added. From this backlog, they select items for
  particular sprint to create a sprint backlog, which contains tasks to be completed in that sprint.

## Agile Tools:

* The participants mention different Agile project management tools like ZenHub, JIRA, Trello, and GitHub project. Though these tools have slightly different user
 interfaces, the fundamental principles of Agile and Scrum apply to all of them.

## Scrum Workflow:

* The conversation touches upon the Scrum workflow, where tasks go through different stages like design, code, test, and deploy. The team follows a continuous
 flow model, with different team members working on different versions of the product simultaneously.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
They discuss the concept of MVP, which involves delivering the minimum necessary features to create a usable product. They work on different versions of the 
product at the same time, based on what is most recent or needed.

## Collaboration and Communication:
 
* The conversation emphasizes the importance of communication and collaboration in Agile and Scrum. The Product Manager acts as a bridge between the designers and
  developers, facilitating smooth workflow and addressing any questions or issues that arise during the process.

Overall, the above information showcases a basic understanding of Agile and Scrum principles, including the iterative nature of development, self-organization
within the team, and the use of visual tools like burn down charts to track progress.
