#### How This Works

* our goal is to get things go where we want them to go around planets around solar system.
* lets we have a new planet which is inhabitable and we want to reach there.
* so accoording to physics in orbital system everything is circular so we are gonna reach out to the new planet in circular motion.
* lets we make a straight line from one planet to the new planet and group the car and the moon with the planet so they will move in circular motion but the moon will come in front of the car which will mess its path. so its clear that straight path is never the best idea.
* now the new planet is not sitting still on its place it is also moving around the sun.
* so if we ungroup the car from the planet and we drive it faster it will sling off  from the planet.
* Whatever's further away is going to move slower around the sun and the one which is closer to the sun will move faster.
* now if we group the moon and the car with the planet andthe car sling off to the new planet that is revolving around the sun but it will not fall off in the straight line to the other planet but will fall off from the planet in a curved motion. so for this sling shot of car we are using the earth rotaional energy. 
* what comes next is we are going to sling shot the car to the moon and then to the new planet so in this case we are doing two sling shot so after that in the same manner we will launch more and more cars which in turn will create a moon car planet so like from teeny tiny project you can eventually launch it and it becomes its own star so thats why we use the star tracking system in the Orbital.
* so first in orbital system when you are launching a car you have to lookover to your space and then the path that the car follow which is the track actually after then what assistance you need to do in traveling over that track which is simply putting gas giving the padle and drive the car in that track. and the end goal is to get to the Kepler(Suppose planet name)
* so you have to think of the whole ecosystem when u are launching something you have to be aware of everything that comes in its path so you should be well aware of any problem that is coming in its path.
