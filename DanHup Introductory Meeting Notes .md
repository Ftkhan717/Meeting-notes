Let suppose someone wants a director role job and he is already working on this post. First we will tell the client that we will help you out to get a job for you.  
Then we will tell a coordinator who will be working under the client. The coordinator will then arrange a meeting with his staff who will be working under him. They
will then discuss what job we can offer to the client. 
Following are the ways of how we can find a job for the client: 

## 1)CANDIDATE RELATIONSHIP: 

* First we will build a friendly relationship with the candidate so that we can find out, why he needs this job?, and why the client quit his another job?. 

## 2)CANDIDATE PROFILE: 

In the second step we will look the profile of candidate that whether he is suitable for job of director role or not. We also need to analyze that the alignment of the client knowledge, expertise and education makes him fit for that job or not. Before offering him any role in job we will first see his scope in any field. After taking an overview of his profile then we will think that which focus pass is suitable for him. 

As there are different levels of focus pass so each focus pass provide different services. 

Let suppose if Silver focus pass then there will be little services provided to the client. 

If Gold focus pass then the services provided will be more beneficial to the client. 

If White Gold focus pass then services will get more better for the client. 

So with each level it gets better. 

 

3)CANDIDATE TRAINING: 

Thirdly, we'll check the resume or curriculum vitae(CV) of client so that we can know what is written in CV, what are the requirement of the client. Does the client have all the skills that are required for that particular job or not?, Does he know about the latest technology that are the requirement of that job. 

For Example :  

If he donâ€™t know what is SDLC,SMART STAR, Leadership thoughts and decision making so we will give him training about it. 

 

4)CANDIDATE INTERVIEW PREP: 

After proper training, negotiation and setting the client profile we will then make him prepare for the Moch interviews. We will now test that the training we had given to him makes him capable of doing his daily tasks or not. He should be up to date with everything that he had learned in training. 

 

5)COORDINATOR RESPONSIBILITIES: 

Now how can they apply for jobs?, so the answer is RDP. Therefore through RDP they can apply for job. RDP actually provide you the path to help you connect with others computers internationally. So when the client provide you his/her RDP server so you can connect your computer with his computer without any need of login details. So from his accounts they can apply for different job, i.e. on LinkedIn, Upwork Inc., and Angel.co etc. Moreover, they can set his interviews with help of Meeting Calendar app where there interviews can be scheduled. 

 

6)CANDIDATE REPRESENTATION: 

The representation of the client is very important. The client from his profile photo should be looking professional. The client professionalism should be clearly visible from his/her profile.
