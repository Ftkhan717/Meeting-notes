## Repository Management and Website Modification Workflow


### Forking the Repository:



* Begin by forking the repository. This action creates a personal copy of the repository where you can make changes without affecting the original project.



### Accessing Milestones:



* After forking, navigate to the 'Milestones' section. This is typically represented by a circular icon and is used to track progress on groups of issues or pull requests (PRs).



### Managing Issues and PRs:



* Within the Milestones section, you will find two types of items: issues and PRs. Issues are used to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your work. PRs, on the other hand,
are proposed changes to the codebase that need to be reviewed before they can be incorporated.



### Commenting and Link Sharing:



* Feel free to comment on any issue or PR. After commenting, you can share this information by clicking on the three dots (more options), selecting 'Copy Link', and pasting this
link into the Focus app.



### Code Modification:



* Next, click on the 'Code' section. This is where the actual code for the project resides.



### Creating GitHub Pages:



* Create a new GitHub page for your changes. GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files
through a build process, and publishes a website.



### Modifying the Website:



* Finally, click on the 'index.html' file to make changes to the website. This is the main HTML file that your browser reads to display the web page. After making your changes, 
save the file to update the website.

## Repository Management and Website Modification Procedure:


### Forking the Repository:



* Begin by forking the repository. This creates a personal copy of the repository where you can make changes without affecting the original project.



### Accessing Milestones and Issues:



* Next, click on the 'Milestone' option. This will lead you to a page where you can view and manage project milestones. On this page, you will find two types of items: issues and pull requests (PRs). Issues are represented by circles, while PRs have a different icon.



### Commenting and Link Sharing:



* Proceed to comment on the issue or PR. After commenting, click on the three-dot menu next to your comment and select 'Copy Link'. This link can then be pasted into the Focus app for easy access and reference.



### Code Modification and Website Changes:



* Click on the 'Code' option to view the project's codebase. Here, you can create GitHub (gh) pages for the project. Once the gh pages are created, click on the 'index.html' file.
* This is where you can make changes to the website's front-end design and content.
