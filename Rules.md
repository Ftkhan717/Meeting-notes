## Etiquette Guidelines for Effective Microsoft Teams Calls in a Business Setting:

* Here are some general guidelines and etiquette rules that can be followed during calls on Microsoft Teams:

### Use an appropriate microphone:

Ensure you have a good-quality microphone that delivers clear sound without excessive background noise.

### Speak clearly:

Enunciate your words and maintain a moderate pace while speaking. Avoid mumbling or speaking too quickly.

### Camera usage:

It's generally recommended to have your camera on during meetings to facilitate better engagement and visual connection. While it's not necessary to keep it on all the time,
consider turning it on for at least 20% of your meeting time.

### Dress appropriately:

Dress professionally, taking into account the context of the meeting. Follow your organization's dress code guidelines or choose attire that reflects a business-like appearance.

### Grooming:

Ensure that you present yourself well by grooming appropriately. This applies to both men and women, including aspects such as combing your hair, maintaining a clean-shaven 
appearance (for men), and paying attention to personal hygiene.

### Stay communicative throughout:

Active participation and engagement are crucial during meetings. Stay attentive, actively listen, and contribute to the discussion when appropriate. Avoid distractions and side 
conversations.

### Maintain a business tone:

Microsoft Teams meetings are typically conducted for business purposes, so it's important to maintain a professional tone. Use a polite and respectful language, and avoid using 
slang or informal expressions that may be deemed unprofessional.

### Be prepared to talk:

In business meetings, it's expected that participants actively contribute by sharing their thoughts, ideas, and insights. Come prepared with any relevant information or points you
want to discuss and be ready to engage in meaningful conversation.

Remember, these guidelines may vary depending on the specific context and culture of your organization. It's always a good idea to be mindful of the expectations set by your 
company and adapt accordingly.
