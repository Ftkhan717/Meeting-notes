* Oktopods is like a group of four people. In this group one person is acting like a head and the other three people are co-workers of the head. These three people are assisting the head in his task.
* One of the king region in oktopods is communication, throughh communication we can interact with each other effectively to compelete that task. I can't talk about the task right now, because the tasks differ depends on what the head is doing. So basically the head has all the work.
* So to take an initiative to ask the head "what can i do to help you?" or "what can I do to help the team". So it's like more structured.
* As I am working on one of the oktopods so by using KVM, I can watch him(my head) work and see how can I can help him out.
